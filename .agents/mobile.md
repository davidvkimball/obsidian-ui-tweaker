# Mobile

## Plugins

- Where feasible, test on iOS and Android.
- Don't assume desktop-only behavior unless `isDesktopOnly` is `true`.
- Avoid large in-memory structures; be mindful of memory and storage constraints.

## Themes

- Test themes on iOS and Android devices.
- Ensure CSS works correctly on mobile viewports.
- Consider touch-friendly UI elements and spacing.
- Test theme appearance in both light and dark modes on mobile.
